# Law of Large Numbers 

### What is the law of large numbers? 

In Mathematics is defined as

In probability and statistics, the law of large numbers says that as a sample size increases (Xn), its mean gets closer to the average of the entire population (Ex). This is because as the sample size increases, the sample becomes more representative of the population.

Let's assume that we flip a coin 10, 100, 1000, 10,000 times and count how many times we get heads or tails. Intuitively speaking, we should expect to have 50% chance of getting heads and 50% of getting tails.

| NumOfTimes | Heads | Tails | Percentage of Heads | Percentage of Tails |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 10 | 3 | 7 | 30% | 70% |
| 100 | 47 | 53 | 44% | 56% |  
| 1000 | 502 | 498 | 50.2% | 49.8% |
  
 We can see, that if we flip the coin 10 times, the percentages are too off from being 50% each; however, as we increase the number of times the coin is flipped, average rates approach the expected value.

ðŸ¤” Ever wondered why gamblers always end up loosing? Why do they have a much lower chance of winning than losing?

Every day, casinos and other gambling businesses operate on the principle of the law of large numbers.
